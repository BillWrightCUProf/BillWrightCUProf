- 👋 Hi, I’m @BillWrightCUProf -- Bill Wright. I'm a Computer Science Professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
- 👀 I’m interested in Object-Oriented Programming, as I teach a course on that, but I'm interested in all things computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Kotlin, Scala
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing just yet, but I'm working on some ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me at Bill.Wright@colorado.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wrote a book on speed climbing and am a race director (Rattlessnake Ramble)
